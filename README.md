# Pomodoly
Just a dead simple pomodoro timer, created using the latest web technologies.

## How to use?
1. Choose a task to be accomplished
2. Start the Pomodoro timer.
3. Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings.
4. Take a short break.
5. Every 4 Pomodoros take a long break.

Starting a timer disposes the current one if there.

## Latest web technologies?
Pomodoly is created using the latest web technologies. This included HTML5 and CSS3. We didn't used any image, all eye candy you see is created using CSS, the alarm animation included.

### The list
Here is a list of cool new web technologies we used:
* HTML5
** Web symantics

## Supported browsers
Currently only the latest editions of Google Chrome and Safari are supported.

Only these two support all the HTML5 and CSS3 stuff we used.
